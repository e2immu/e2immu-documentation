=== Default annotations

When annotating abstract types and methods, or types in the Annotated APIs, observe the following rules.

A method is {nm} unless otherwise specified, its parameters are assumed to be {modified}, unless they are of
immutable type.

Due to the large amount of circular type dependencies in the JDK, combined with the current limitations of the analyser,
the implementation of the Annotated API analyser requires contracted annotations about independence,
immutability, and container on the type.
The following combinations are possible with respect ot independence and immutability:

* no independence information: (in)dependence according to the immutability value
(not immutable -> dependent, {immutableHC} -> {independentHC}, {immutable} -> {independent})
* {independentAbsent}: dependent; this requires that the type is not immutable
* {independentHC}: this is the default for {immutableHC}, {immutableContainerHC}, so explicitly writing this annotation
 is only necessary on non-immutable types
* {independent}: this is the default for {immutable}, {immutableContainer}, so so explicitly writing this annotation
is only useful for mutable or {immutableHC} types

Recall that abstract types always have hidden content, so the `hc=true` is always implicitly present on
{independent} and {immutable}, {immutableContainer} on the type.
We generally do not write `hc=false`, as that is the default value in the annotation.
The analyser will complain when `hc=false` is present on the {immutable} annotation of an abstract type.

To support the user, a warning will be raised when the independence value on the type is incompatible with
that on its methods, parameters and fields.

In a {container} type, all {fluent} methods and all void methods are assumed to be {modified}.
Change this by explicitly marking the method {nm} or {sse}.

Parameters of a non-modifying method are {independent} by default, regardless of an independence annotation on the type.
This can be overwritten by {independentAbsent} or {independentHC} when the method exposes parts of the fields' object graph via its parameters.
Parameters of a modifying method are assumed to be dependent when the type is not immutable, and independent when the type is immutable, the hidden content carrying over from immutable to independent.

Dependence is only explicitly written as {independentAbsent} on a type after analysis, when this type has (eventually) final fields and no modifying methods, as a marker to the user to indicate that it is the independence property that is missing to reach immutability.
Marking a non-immutable type with {independent} specifies that no parameter or return value can be dependent.
The hidden content parameter given by the user is ignored: you will still have to mark any method or parameter which communicates hidden content with {independentHC}.

When a type is immutable, {independent} becomes the default independence annotation for methods and parameters.
You must still use {independentHC} to indicate communication of hidden content.

Methods marked {fluent} are always {independent}, because returning the type itself does not expose any additional information.

Following its definition, {utilityClass} on a type implies {immutable}.

In application mode, the analyser will regard every class that is never extended as effectively final.
This property is only relevant when the type is immutable; the absence of `hc=true` is a marker.

Parameters of "official" functional interface type (i.e., the type is a functional interface type in the package
`java.util.function`) have the {ignoreModifications} annotation, unless explicitly overwritten by {modified}.

The default nullable annotation for parameters and return values of non-primitive type is {nullable}.

A factory method is a static method returning an object of the type of the class.
Independence of a factory method is always with respect to the method's parameters, rather than to the type.
Independence of a factory method's parameters corresponds to the immutability of the parameter type.
These two rules also applies to any static method in an immutable type.
Note that utility classes are classes that are deeply immutable and cannot be instantiated, so it applies to their static methods.

In general, annotations are inherited on types, methods and parameters.
The properties can deviate,

- from {modified} to {nm} is possible, from {nm} to {modified} is not
- independence can go from left to right in {independentAbsent} -> {independentHC} -> {independent},
but not from right to left
- a type deriving from an immutable type does not need to be immutable; however, a type deriving from a
non-immutable type can never be immutable

When a method has a single statement, returning a constant value, the `@ImmutableContainer("value")` is implicit.
Similarly, when a field is explicitly final (it has the `final` modifier) and it has an initialiser, then both {final}
and, if relevant, `@ImmutableContainer("value")`, is implicit.
