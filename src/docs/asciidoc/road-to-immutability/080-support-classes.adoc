[#support-classes]
== Support classes

The `e2immu-support-1.0.0.jar` library (in whichever version it comes) essentially contains the annotations of the analyser, and a small selection of support types.
They are the eventually immutable building blocks that you can use in your project, irrespective of whether you want analyser support or not.

We discuss a selection of the building blocks here.

[#support-flipswitch]
=== FlipSwitch

Simpler than `FlipSwitch` is not possible for an eventually immutable type: it consists solely of a single boolean, which is at the same time the data and the guard:

.Code fragment: most of FlipSwitch
[source,java]
----
@E2Container(after = "t")
public class FlipSwitch {

    @Final(after = "t")
    private volatile boolean t;

    private boolean set$Precondition() { return !t; } // <1>
    @Mark("t")
    public void set() {
        if (t) throw new IllegalStateException("Already set");
        t = true;
    }

    @NotModified
    @TestMark("t")
    public boolean isSet() {
        return t;
    }

    private boolean copy$Precondition() { return !t; } // <1>
    @Mark("t") // but conditionally
    public void copy(FlipSwitch other) {
        if (other.isSet()) set();
    }
}
----
<1> This companion method is present in the code to validate the computation of the precondition.
See <<preconditions-and-instance-state>> for more details.

Note that methods which only conditionally change the immutability status of a type, such as `copy`, also get a {mark} annotation.
The analyser is not omniscient, and plays safe.

The obvious use case for this helper class is to indicate whether a certain job has been done, or not.

[#support-setonce]
=== SetOnce

One step up from `FlipSwitch` is `SetOnce`: a place-holder for one object which can be filled exactly once:

.Code fragment: parts of SetOnce
[source,java]
----
@E2Container(after = "t")
public class SetOnce<T> {

    @Final(after = "t")
    private volatile T t;

    @Mark("t")
    public void set(@NotNull T t) {
        if (t == null) throw new NullPointerException("Null not allowed");
        if (this.t != null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Already set: have " + this.t + ", try to set " + t);
        }
        this.t = t;
    }

    @Only(after = "t")
    @NotNull
    @NotModified
    public T get() {
        if (t == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Not yet set");
        }
        return t;
    }

    @NotModified
    @TestMark("t")
    public boolean isSet() {
        return t != null;
    }

    @NotModified
    public T getOrElse(T alternative) {
        if (isSet()) return get();
        return alternative;
    }
}
----

The analyser relies heavily on this type, with additional support to allow setting multiple times, with exactly the same value.
This can be ascertained with a helper method, which, as noted in the previous section, also gets the {mark} annotation.

[#support-eventuallyfinal]
=== EventuallyFinal

Slightly more flexible than `SetOnce` is `EventuallyFinal`: the type allows you to keep writing objects using the `setVariable`
method, until you write using `setFinal`.
Then, the state changes and the type becomes level 2 immutable:

.Code fragment: EventuallyFinal
[source,java]
----
@E2Container(after = "isFinal")
public class EventuallyFinal<T> {
    private T value;
    private boolean isFinal;

    public T get() {
        return value;
    }

    @Mark("isFinal")
    public void setFinal(T value) {
        if (this.isFinal) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Trying to overwrite a final value");
        }
        this.isFinal = true;
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Only(before = "isFinal")
    public void setVariable(T value) {
        if (this.isFinal) throw new IllegalStateException("Value is already final");
        this.value = value;
    }

    @TestMark("isFinal")
    public boolean isFinal() {
        return isFinal;
    }

    @TestMark(value = "isFinal", before = true)
    public boolean isVariable() {
        return !isFinal;
    }
}
----

Here's also an example of a negated {testMark} annotation: `isVariable` return the negation of the normal `iFinal` mark test.

[#support-freezable]
=== Freezable

The previous support class, `EventuallyFinal`, forms the template for a more general approach to eventual immutability:
allow free modifications, until the type is _frozen_ and no modifications can be allowed anymore.

.Code fragment: Freezable
[source,java]
----
@E2Container(after = "frozen")
public abstract class Freezable {

    @Final(after = "frozen")
    private volatile boolean frozen;

    @Mark("frozen")
    public void freeze() {
        ensureNotFrozen();
        frozen = true;
    }

    @TestMark("frozen")
    public boolean isFrozen() {
        return frozen;
    }

    private boolean ensureNotFrozen$Precondition() { return !frozen; } // <1>
    public void ensureNotFrozen() {
        if (frozen) throw new IllegalStateException("Already frozen!");
    }

    private boolean ensureFrozen$Precondition() { return frozen; } // <1>
    public void ensureFrozen() {
        if (!frozen) throw new IllegalStateException("Not yet frozen!");
    }
}
----
<1> This companion method is present in the code to validate the computation of the precondition.
See <<preconditions-and-instance-state>> for more details.

Note that as discussed in <<inheritance>>, it is important for `Freezable`, as an abstract class, to be level 2 immutable:
derived classes can only go _down_ the immutability scale, not up!

[#support-setoncemap]
=== SetOnceMap

We'll show one example that depends on `Freezable`: a freezable map where no objects can be overwritten:

.Code fragment: part of SetOnceMap
[source,java]
----
@E2Container(after = "frozen")
public class SetOnceMap<K, V> extends Freezable {

    private final Map<K, V> map = new HashMap<>();

    @Only(before = "frozen")
    public void put(@NotNull K k, @NotNull V v) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(k);
        Objects.requireNonNull(v);
        ensureNotFrozen();
        if (isSet(k)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Already decided on " + k + ": have " +
                get(k) + ", want to write " + v);
        }
        map.put(k, v);
    }

    @NotNull
    @NotModified
    public V get(K k) {
        if (!isSet(k)) throw new IllegalStateException("Not yet decided on " + k);
        return Objects.requireNonNull(map.get(k)); // <1>
    }

    public boolean isSet(K k) {
        return map.containsKey(k);
    }

    ...
}
----
<1> The analyser will warn a potential null pointer exception here, not (yet) making the connection between
`isSet` and `containsKey`.
This connection can be implemented using the techniques described in <<preconditions-and-instance-state>>.

The code analyser makes frequent use of this type, often with an additional guard that allows repeatedly putting the same value to a key.

[#support-lazy]
=== Lazy

`Lazy` implements a lazily-initialized immutable field, of unbound generic type `T`.
Properly implemented, it is an eventually level 2 immutable type.

.Code fragment: Lazy
[source,java]
----
@E2Container(after = "t")
public class Lazy<T> {

    @NotNull1 @Dependent1
    private final Supplier<T> supplier;

    @Final(after = "t")
    private volatile T t;

    public Lazy(@NotNull1 @Dependent1 Supplier<T> supplier) { // <1>
        this.supplier = supplier;
    }

    @NotNull
    @Mark("t") // <2>
    public T get() {
        if (t != null) return t;
        t = Objects.requireNonNull(supplier.get()); // <3>
        return t;
    }

    @NotModified
    public boolean hasBeenEvaluated() {
        return t != null;
    }
}
----
<1> The annotation has travelled from the field to the parameter; so the parameter has {dependent1}.
<2> The {mark} annotation is conditional; the transition is triggered by nullity of `t`
<3> Here `t` content links to `supplier`, as explained in <<immutable-content-linking>>, which causes the field `supplier` to be marked {dependent1}.
The statement also causes the {nn1} annotation, as defined in <<nullable-section>>.

After calling the marker method `get()`, `t` cannot be assigned anymore, and it becomes {final}.
Because it is of an unbound generic type, it is {nm}, as is the field `supplier`.
Level 2 immutability rules 2 and 3 do not apply for either fields.

[#support-firstthen]
=== FirstThen

[source,java]
----
package org.e2immu.analyser.util;

import org.e2immu.annotation.*;
import java.util.Objects;

@E2Container(after = "mark")
public class FirstThen<S, T> {
    private volatile S first;
    private volatile T then;

    public FirstThen(@NotNull S first) {
        this.first = Objects.requireNonNull(first);
    }

    @NotModified
    public boolean isFirst() {
        return first != null;
    }

    @NotModified
    public boolean isSet() {
        return first == null;
    }

    @Mark("mark")
    public void set(@NotNull T then) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(then);
        synchronized (this) {
            if (first == null) throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Already set");
            this.then = then;
            first = null;
        }
    }

    @NotNull @NotModified @Only(before = "mark")
    public S getFirst() {
        if (first == null)
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Then has been set"); // <1>
        S s = first;
        if (s == null) throw new NullPointerException();
        return s;
    }

    @NotNull @NotModified @Only(after = "mark")
    public T get() {
        if (first != null) throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Not yet set"); // <2>
        T t = then;
        if (t == null) throw new NullPointerException();
        return t;
    }

    @Override // <3>
    public boolean equals(@Nullable Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        FirstThen<?, ?> firstThen = (FirstThen<?, ?>) o;
        return Objects.equals(first, firstThen.first) &&
                Objects.equals(then, firstThen.then);
    }

    @Override // <3>
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(first, then);
    }
}
----
<1> This is a bit convoluted.
The precondition is on the field `first`, and the current implementation of the precondition analyser requires an explicit check on the field.
Because this field is not final, we cannot assume that it is still null after the initial check; therefore, we assign it to a local variable, and do another null check to guarantee that the result that we return is `@NotNull`.

<2> Largely in line with the previous comment: we stick to the precondition on `first`, and have to check `then` to guarantee that the result is `@NotNull`.
<3> The `equals` and `hashCode` methods inherit the {nm} annotation from `java.lang.Object`.

Note that if we were to annotate the methods as contracts, rather than relying on the analyser to detect them, we could have a slightly more efficient implementation.
