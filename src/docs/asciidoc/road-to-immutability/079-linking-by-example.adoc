== Linking by example

Goal is to use this section as a reference: most linking situations should be
described here.

Let `X` be an unbound type parameter, and `M` be a mutable type.
We'll use `String` as the archetypal recursively immutable type.
Furthermore, we'll use the following methods in the examples:

.Example {counter:example}, method annotations in AnnotationAPI format
[source,java]
----
// implicitly mutable
interface List$<X> {
    @Modified // dependent implicitly
    boolean add(@Independent(hc = true) X x);

    @Independent(hc=true) // @NotModified implicitly
    X get(int index);

    // @NotModified, dependent implicitly
    List<X> subList(int from, int to);

    static List<X> copyOf(@Independent(hc=true) Collection<? extends X> c);
}

// implicitly mutable
class ArrayList$<X> {
    ArrayList(@Independent(hc = true) Collection<? extends X> c) {}
}
----

=== Operators

Let us start with the absolute basics: the assignment operator generates a link at the _statically assigned_ level.

.Example {counter:example}, assignments
[source,java]
----
void method(int index, List<String> listS, List<X> listX, List<M> listM) {
    // statically assigned
    List<String> aS = listS;
    List<X> aX = listX;
    List<M> aM = listM;
}
----

The only other operator to allow for meaningful linking is the _inline conditional operator_, which links to both conditions at the _statically assigned_ level:


.Example {counter:example}, assignments
[source,java]
----
void method(boolean b, String s1, String s2, X x1, X x2, M m1, M m2) {
    // s is statically assigned to both s1 and s2
    S s = b  ? s1 : s2;

    // x is statically assigned to both x1 and x2
    X x = b ? x1 : x2;

    // m is statically assigned to both m1 and m2
    M m = b ? m1 : m2;
}
----

All other operators involve recursively immutable objects (primitives, or `String`), and do not link.
Note that {e2immu} will do expression evaluation, therefore, we will see
statical assignments in the following situations:

.Example {counter:example}, assignments
[source,java]
----
void method(int i) {
    // simplified to i1 = i, therefore statically assigned
    int i1 = i + 0;

    // simplified to i2 = i, therefore statically assigned
    int i2 = 1 * i;
}
----

=== Methods

The normal situation for well-designed, non-modifying instance methods is to link the method's object to the method's return value:

.Example {counter:example}, from method object into method result
[source,java]
----
void method(int index, List<String> listS, List<X> listX, List<M> listM) {
    // independent (upgrade from independent HC)
    String s = listS.get(index);

    // independent HC, *-4-0
    X x = listX.get(index);

    // independent HC, *M-4-0M (no downgrade, modification travels)
    M m = listM.get(index);

    // dependent, irrespective of String, X, M
    List<String> subS = listS.subList(0, 2);
    List<X> subX = listX.subList(0, 2);
    List<M> subM = listM.subList(0, 2);

    // independent, upgrade from independent HC
    List<String> copyS = new ArrayList<>(listS.subList(0, 2));

    // independent HC, 0-4-0
    List<X> copyX = new ArrayList<>(listX.subList(0, 2));

    // independent HC, 0M-4-0M (no downgrade, modification travels)
    List<M> copyM = new ArrayList<>(listM.subList(0, 2));

    // independent, immutable
    List<String> immS = List.copyOf(listS);

    // independent HC, 0-4-0, immutable HC
    List<X> immX = List.copyOf(listX);

    // independent HC, 0M-4-0M (no downgrade, modification travels), mutable
    List<M> immM = List.copyOf(listM);
}
----

The normal situation for well-designed modifying methods is to link the method's arguments to the method's object.

.Example {counter:example}, from method arguments into method object
[source,java]
----
void method(String s, X x, M m, List<String> listS, List<X> listX, List<M> listM) {
    // independent
    listS.add(s);

    // independent HC, *-4-0
    listX.add(x);

    // dependent
    listM.add(m);
}
----

Links from the method parameters directly into the method result are obviously possible, but recognized by the analyser only in the case of an {identity} method:

.Example {counter:example}, identity method links argument to method result
[source,java]
----
void method(String s, X x, M m) {
    // assigned
    S s1 = Objects.requireNonNull(s);
    X x1 = Objects.requireNonNull(x);
    M m1 = Objects.requireNonNull(m);
}
----

Links between parameters are not recognized by the analyser, but can be added via the AnnotatedAPI files, as in `Collections.addAll()`:

.Example {counter:example}, links between parameters
[source,java]
----

----

=== Constructors

The normal situation for constructors is to link the arguments to the newly constructed object.

=== Functional interfaces

The situation becomes more complicated when we consider method arguments that are of functional interface type: method references, lambda's, anonymous classes, and any variable representing such objects.

The analyser applies the following linking rule:

****
* If the SAM is modifying, its arguments link to its object.
* If the SAM is non-modifying, its arguments link to its return value.
****

No other combinations have currently been implemented.

.Example {counter:example}, links between parameters
[source,java]
----
void method() {
    inX.forEach(outX::add);
    inX.forEach(x -> outX.add(x));
    inX.forEach(new Consumer<X> {
        void accept(X x) {
            outX.add(x);
        }
    });
}
