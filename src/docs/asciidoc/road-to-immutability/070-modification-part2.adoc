== Modification, part 2

This section goes deeper into modification, linking and independence.
We start with cyclic references.

=== Cyclic references

We need to study the situation of seemingly non-modifying methods with modifying parameters.
Up to now, a method is only modifying when it assigns to a field, calls a modifying method on one of the fields, or directly calls a modifying method on `this`.
However, there could be indirect modifications, as in:

.Example {counter:example}, indirect modifications
[source,java]
----
@E2Container
public class CyclicReferences {

    @MutableModifiesArguments
    static class C1 {

        @Variable
        private int i;

        @Modified
        public int incrementAndGet() {
            return ++i;
        }

        @Modified // <1>
        public int useC2(@Modified C2 c2) {
            return i + c2.incrementAndGetWithI();
        }

    }

    @E1Immutable
    static class C2 {

        private final int j;

        @Modified
        private final C1 c1;

        public C2(int j, @Modified C1 c1) {
            this.c1 = c1;
            this.j = j;
        }

        @Modified
        public int incrementAndGetWithI() {
            return c1.incrementAndGet() + j;
        }
    }
}
----

<1> `useC2` does not directly modify `i`, but `incrementAndGetWithI` does so indirectly.

This observation forces us to tighten the definition of a non-modifying method: on top of the definition given above, we have to ensure that none of the modifying methods called on a parameter which is {modified}, call one of 'our' modifying methods.
These rules are mostly, but not easily, enforceable when all code is visible.

An additional interface can help to remove the circular dependency between the types.
This has the advantage of simplicity, both for the programmer and the analyser, which at this point doesn't handle circular dependencies very well.
It imposes more annotation work on the programmer, however, because the interface's methods need contracts.

[#computing-dependence]
=== How to compute linking

To compute linking, the analyser tries to track actual objects, with the aim of knowing if a field links to another field or a parameter.
It computes a dependency graph of variables depending on other variables, with the following four basic rules:

****
Rule 1: in an assignment `v = w`, variable `v` links to variable `w`.
****

****
Rule 2: in an assignment `v = a.method(b)`,`v` potentially links to `a` and `b`.
****

Note that saying `v` links to `a` is the same as saying that the return value of `method` links to some field inside `A`, the type of `a`.
This is especially clear when `a == this`.

We discern a number of special cases:

. When `v` is of {e2immutable} type, there cannot be any linking; `v` does not link to `a` nor `b`.
. If `b` is of {e2immutable} type, `v` cannot link to `b`.
. When `method` has the annotation {independent}, `v` cannot link to `a`.
. If `a` is of {independent} type (as defined in <<independent-type>>, it includes all {e2immutable} types), all its methods are independent; therefore, `v` cannot link to `a`.

Recall that primitives, `java.lang.Object`, `java.lang.String`, and unbound parameter types, are {e2immutable}.

****
Rule 3: in an assignment `v = new A(b)`, `v` potentially links to `b`.
****

. When the constructor `A` is independent, `v` cannot link to `b`.
. When `b` is of {e2immutable} type, `v` cannot link to `b`.
. If `A` is {e2immutable}, then `v` cannot link to `b` nor `c`, because all constructors are independent.

Most of the other linking computations are consequences of the basic rules above.
For example,

. in an assignment `v = condition ? a : b`, `v` links to both `a` and `b`.
. type casting does not prevent linking: in `v = (Type)w`, `v` links to `w`
. Binary operators return primitives or `java.lang.String`, which prevents linking: in `v = a + b`, `v` does not link to `a` nor `b`.

****
Rule 4: in an array access `v = a[index]`, `v` links to `a`.
****

Note: in a method call `v=a.method(b, c, d)`, links between `b`, `c`, and `d` are possible.
They are covered by the {modified} annotation:
when a parameter is {nm}, no modifications at all are possible, not even indirectly.

=== Locally implemented abstract methods

Abstract methods are present in interfaces, and abstract classes.
Their very definition is that no implementation is present at the place of definition: only the ins (parameters) and outs (return type) are pre-defined.

Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method; any other methods in the interface are required to have a `default` implementation.
The following table lists some frequently used ones:

[options=header]
|===

| Name | single abstract method (SAM)
| `Consumer<T>` | `void accept(T t);`
| `Function<T,R>` | `R apply(T t);`
| `BiFunction<T, U, R>` | `R apply(T t, U u);`
| `Supplier<R>` | `R get();`
| `Predicate<T>` | `boolean test(T t);`
|===

It is important not to forget that _any_ interface defining a single abstract method can be seen as a functional interface.
While the examples above all employ generics (more specifically, unbound type parameters), generics are not a requirement for functional interfaces.
The Java language offers syntactic sugar for functional programming, but the types remain abstract Java types.

We will not make any distinction between a functional interface and an abstract type.
If one were forced to make one, the _intention to hold data_ would be the dividing line between a functional interface, which conveys no such intention, and an abstract type, which does.

In this section we want to discuss a limited application of functional interfaces: the one where the SAMs have a local implementation.
The general case, where objects of abstract types come in via a parameter, will be addressed in <<immutable-content>>.
Consider the following example:

.Example {counter:example}, concrete implementation of suppliers
[source,java]
----
@E1Container
class ApplyLocalFunctions {

    @Container
    static class Counter {
        private int counter;

        @Modified
        public int increment() {
            return ++counter;
        }
    }

    @Modified // <1>
    private final Counter myCounter = new Counter();

    @Modified // <2>
    private final Supplier<Integer> getAndIncrement = myCounter::increment;

    @Modified
    private final Supplier<Integer> explicitGetAndIncrement = new Supplier<Integer>() {
        @Override @Modified
        public Integer get() {
            return myCounter.increment();
        }
    };

    @Modified
    public int myIncrementer() {
        return getAndIncrement.get();
    }

    @Modified
    public int myExplicitIncrementer() {
        return explicitGetAndIncrement.get();
    }
}
----
<1> Modified in `getAndIncrement` and `explicitGetAndIncrement`
<2> Modified because its modifying method (`get`) is called in `myIncrementer`

The fields `getAndIncrement` and `explicitGetAndIncrement` hold instances of anonymous _inner classes_ of `ApplyLocalFunctions`: these inner classes hold data, they have access to the `myCounter` field.
Their concrete implementations of `get` each modify `myCounter`.
A straightforward application of the rules of modification of fields makes  `getAndIncrement` and `explicitGetAndIncrement` {modified}:
in `myIncrementer`, a modifying method is applied to `getAndIncrement`, and in `myExplicitIncrementer`, a modifying method is applied to `explicitGetAndIncrement`.

Given that `ApplyLocalFunctions` is clearly {e1container}, and the inner classes hold no other data, the inner classes are {e1container} as well.

Now, if we move away from suppliers, but use consumers, we can discuss:

.Example {counter:example}, concrete implementation of consumers
[source,java]
----
class ApplyLocalFunctions2 {

    @Container
    static class Counter {
        private int counter;

        @NotModified
        public int getCounter() {
            return counter;
        }

        @Modified
        public int increment() {
            return ++counter;
        }
    }

    @NotModified
    private final Counter myCounter = new Counter();

    @E2Immutable // <1>
    private static final Consumer<Counter> incrementer = Counter::increment;

    @E2Immutable
    private static final Consumer<Counter> explicitIncrementer = new Consumer<Counter>() {
        @Override
        @NotModified
        public void accept(@Modified Counter counter) { // <2>
            counter.increment();
        }
    };

    @E2Container // <3>
    private static final Consumer<Counter> printer = counter ->
        System.out.println("Have " + counter.getCounter());

    @E2Container
    private static final Consumer<Counter> explicitPrinter = new Consumer<Counter>() {
        @Override
        @NotModified
        public void accept(@NotModified Counter counter) { // <4>
            System.out.println("Have " + counter.getCounter());
        }
    };

    private void apply(@Container(contract = true) Consumer<Counter> consumer) { // <5>
        consumer.accept(myCounter);
    }

    public void useApply() {
        apply(printer); // should be fine
        apply(explicitPrinter);
        apply(incrementer); // should cause an ERROR <6>
        apply(explicitIncrementer); // should cause an ERROR
    }
}

<1> The anonymous type is static, has no fields, so is at least {e2immutable}.
It is not a container.
This is clearly visible in the explicit variant...
<2> Here we see why `incrementer` is not a container: the method modifies its parameters.
<3> Now, we have a container, because in the anonymous type does not modify its parameters.
<4> Explicitly visible here in `explicitPrinter`.
<5> If we insist that all parameters are containers, ...
<6> We can use the annotations to detect errors.
Here, `incrementer` is not a container.

Using the {container} annotation in a dynamic way allows us to control which abstract types can use the method:
when only containers are allowed, then the abstract types must not have implementations which change their parameters.
