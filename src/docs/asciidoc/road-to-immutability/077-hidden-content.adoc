[#hidden-content]
== More on hidden content

In this section, we consider modifications to the hidden content of a type, and explain when they are of importance.

=== Visitors

Let's go back to `NonEmptyImmutableList`, first defined in <<abstract-methods>>:

.Example {counter:example}, revisiting `NonEmptyImmutableList`
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer
interface NonEmptyImmutableList<T> extends HasSize {

    // implicitly present: @NotModified
    @Independent(hc=true)
    T first();

    // implicitly present: @NotModified
    void visit(@Independent(hc=true) Consumer<T> consumer); // implicitly present: @NotModified

    @NotModified
    @Override
    default boolean isEmpty() {
        return false;
    }
}
----

We start the discussion with the following immutable implementation of this interface:

.Example {counter:example}, immutable implementation of `NonEmptyImmutableList`
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer
class ImmutableOne<T> implements NonEmptyImmutableList<T> {
    private final T t;

    public ImmutableOne(@Independent(hc=true) T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    @Override
    public int size() {
        return 1;
    }

    @Override
    public T first() {
        return t;
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(Consumer<T> consumer) {
        consumer.accept(t);
    }
}
----

According to the interface contract, we need the `visit` method to be non-modifying,
and also not to modify its parameter `consumer`.
However, following the normal definitions of modification, the following two statements hold:

1. Because `accept` is {modified}, we should mark the parameter `consumer` as {modified}.
2. Because `t`, the parameter of `accept`, is {modified}, we should mark `visit` as {modified}.

The result of the first statement would violate the `@Container` property on `ImmutableOne`, and we'd be very
reluctant to do that:
according to the intuitive definition in <<containers>>, `ImmutableOne` is a type that holds data, but does not
change the data it has been given.
This statement still holds in the presence of a `visit` method, which is nothing but a way of exposing the object
in a way similar to the method `first`.
The second statement would make `visit` modifying, which again goes against our intuition:
looping over elements is, in itself, not modifying.

Luckily, there are two observations that come to the rescue.

First, we believe it is correct to assume that concrete implementations of `Consumer` are semantically
unrelated to `ImmutableOne`.
As a consequence, we could say that the only modifications that concern us in this `visit` method, are the
potential modifications to `accept` 's parameter `t`.
Other modifications, for example those to the fields of the type in which the implementation is present,
may be considered to be outside our scope.

However, if we replace `Consumer` by `Set` and `accept` by `add`, we encounter a modification that we really do not
want to ignore, in an otherwise equal setting.
Therefore, it does not look like we can reason away potential modifications by `accept`.
We will have to revert to a contracted {ignoreModifications} annotation on the parameter `consumer`,
if we want to avoid `ImmutableOne` losing the `@Container` property.

While we will ignore this second source of modification in the `ImmutableOne` type,
we will _defer_ or _propagate_ it to the place where a concrete implementation of the consumer is presented.
We can ignore it here, because `t` is part of the hidden content of the type; what happens to
its content happens outside the zone of control of `ImmutableOne`.
The fact that it is passed as an argument to a method of `consumer` is reflected by the {independent} annotation.
It will take care of the propagation of modifications from the concrete implementation into the hidden content.

This results in the following annotations for `visit` in `ImmutableOne`:

.Example {counter:example}, the `visit` method in `ImmutableOne`, fully annotated
[source,java]
----
@NotModified
public void visit(@IgnoreModifications @Independent(hc=true) Consumer<T> consumer) {
    consumer.accept(t);
}
----

Note that we assume that we will need {ignoreModifications} for almost every use of a functional interface
from the package `java.util.function` occurring as a parameter.
These types are for generic use; one should never use them to represent some specific data type where modifications
are of concern to the current type.
Therefore, we make this annotation implicit in exactly this context.

IMPORTANT: A parameter of a formal functional interface type of `java.util.function`
 will be marked {ignoreModifications} implicitly.

Looking at the more general case of a `forEach` implementation iterating over a list or array, we therefore end up with:

.Example {counter:example}, a generic `forEach` implementation
[source,java]
----
@NotModified
public void forEach(@Independent(hc=true) Consumer<T> consumer) {
    for(T t: list) consumer.accept(t);
}
----

Modifications to the parameter, made by the concrete implementation, are propagated into the hidden content of `list`,
as shown in the next section.
The {independent} annotation appears because hidden content in `list` is exposed to the `consumer` parameter.
This annotation does not appear for the accessible content of the immutable type.

Recall that parameters of modifiable type can already be shielded from external modification by
the {independent} annotation.

=== Propagating modifications

Let us apply the `visit` method of `NonEmptyImmutableList` to `StringBuilder`:

.Example {counter:example}, propagating the modification of `visit`
[source,java]
----
static void print(@NotModified NonEmptyImmutableList<StringBuilder> list) {
    one.visit(System.out::println); // <1>
}

static void addNewLine(@Modified NonEmptyImmutableList<StringBuilder> list) {
    one.visit(sb -> sb.append("\n")); // <2>
}
----

<1> Non-modifying method implies no modification on the hidden content of `list`.
<2> Parameter-modifying lambda propagates a modification to `list` 's hidden content.

It is the second method, `addNewLine`, that is of importance here.
Thanks to the {modified} annotation, we know of a modification to `list`.
It may help to see the for-loop written out, if we temporarily assume that we have added an implementation of
`Iterable` to `NonEmptyImmutableList`, functionally identical to `visit`:

.Example {counter:example}, alternative implementation of `addNewLine`
[source,java]
----
static void addNewLine(@Modified NonEmptyImmutableList<StringBuilder> list) {
    for(StringBuilder sb: list) {
        sb.append("\n"));
    }
}
----

Note that while `NonEmptyImmutableList` is immutable, its concrete instantiation gives access to a modifying method
in its hidden content.

We really need the link between `sb` and `list` for the modification on `sb` to propagate to `list`.
Without this propagation, we would not be able to implement the full definition of modification of parameters,
as stipulated in <<modification>>, in this relatively straightforward and probably frequently occurring situation.

Moving from `NonEmptyImmutableList` to `NonEmptyList`, defined <<NonEmptyList, here>>, which has a modifying method,
 allows us to contrast two different modifications:

.Example {counter:example}, contrasting the modification on the parameter `sb` to that on `list`
[source,java]
----
static void addNewLine(@Modified NonEmptyList<StringBuilder> list) {
    list.visit(sb -> sb.append("\n")); // <1>
}

static void replace(@Modified NonEmptyList<StringBuilder> list) {
    list.setFirst(new StringBuilder("?")); // <2>
}
----

<1> Modification to the hidden content of `list`
<2> Modification to the modifiable content of `list`

Without storing additional information (e.g., using an as yet undefined parameter like `@Modified(hc=true)` on `list`
in `addNewLine`), however, we cannot make the distinction between a modification to the string builders
inside `list`, or a modification to `list` itself.
In other words, applying the two methods further on, we cannot compute

.Example {counter:example}, using `print` and `addNewLine`
[source,java]
----
static String useAddNewLine(@NotModified StringBuilder input) { // <1>
    NonEmptyList<StringBuilder> list = new One<>();
    list.setFirst(input);
    addNewLine(list);
    return list.getFirst().toString();
}

static String useReplace(@NotModified StringBuilder input) {
    NonEmptyList<StringBuilder> list = new One<>();
    list.setFirst(input);
    replace(list); // <2>
    return list.getFirst().toString();
}
----

<1> Should be {modified}, however, in the 3rd statement we cannot know that the modification is to `input` rather than to `list`
<2> This action discards `input` from `list` without modifying it.

****
The example shows that the introduction of {independent} only gets us so far: from the concrete, modifying implementation, to the parameter (or field).
We do not plan to keep track of the distinction between modification of hidden content vs modification of modifiable content to a further extent.
****

Finally, we mention again the modification to a field from a concrete lambda:

.Example {counter:example}, modification of a field outside the scope
[source,java]
----
List<String> strings = ...
@Modified
void addToStrings(@NotModified NonEmptyList<StringBuilder> list) {
  list.visit(sb -> strings.add(sb.toString()));
}
----

[#content-linking]
=== Content linking

Going back to `ImmutableOne`, we see that the constructor links the parameter `t` to the instance's field by
means of assignment.
Let us call this binding of parameters of hidden content to the field _content linking_,
and mark it using {independentHc}, _content dependence_:

.Example {counter:example}, constructor of `ImmutableOne`
[source,java]
----
private final T t;

public ImmutableOne(@Independent(hc=true) T t) {
    this.t = t;
}
----

Returning a part of the hidden content of the type, or exposing it as argument, both warrants a {independentHc}
annotation:

.Example {counter:example}, more methods of `ImmutableOne`
[source,java]
----
@Independent(hc=true)
@Override
public T first() {
    return t;
}

@Override
public void visit(@Independent(hc=true) Consumer<T> consumer) {
    consumer.accept(t);
}
----

Observe that content dependence implies absence of dependence, as described in <<linking-and-independence>>
and <<computing-dependence>>, exactly because we are dealing with type parameters of an immutable type.

Another place where the hidden content linking can be seen, is the _for-each_ statement:

.Example {counter:example}, for-each loop and hidden content linking
[source,java]
----
ImmutableList<StringBuilder> list = ...;
List<StringBuilder> builders = ...;
for(StringBuilder sb: list) {
    builders.add(sb);
}
----

Because the `Collection` API contains an `add` method annotated as:

.Example {counter:example}, `add` in `Collection` annotated
[source,java]
----
@Modified
boolean add(@NotNull @Independent(hc=true) E e);
----

indicating that after calling `add`, the argument will become part of the hidden content of the collection,
we conclude that the local loop variable `sb` gets content linked to the `builders` list.
Similarly, this loop variable contains hidden content from the `list` object.

Let us look at a possible implementation of `Collection.addAll`:

.Example {counter:example}, a possible implementation of `addAll` in `Collection`
[source,java]
----
@Modified
boolean addAll(@NotNull(content=true) @Independent(hc=true) Collection<? extends E> collection) {
    boolean modified = false;
    for (E e : c) if (add(e)) modified = true;
    return modified;
}
----

The call to `add` content links `e` to `this`.
Because `e` is also content linked to `c`, the parameter `collection` holds content linked to the hidden content of
the instance.

We are now properly armed to see how a for-each loop can be implemented using an iterator whose hidden content
links to that of a container.

=== Iterator, Iterable, loops

Let us start with the simplest definition of an iterator, without `remove` method:

.Example {counter:example}, the `Iterator` type, without `remove` method
[source,java]
----
@Container
interface Iterator<T> {

    @Modified
    @Independent(hc=true)
    T next();

    @Modified
    boolean hasNext();
}
----

Either the `next` method, or the `hasNext` method, must make a change to the iterator, because it has to keep track
of the next element.
As such, we make both {modified}.
Following the discussion in the previous section, `next` is {independentHc}, because it returns part of the hidden
content held by the iterator.

The interface `Iterable` is a supplier of iterators:

.Example {counter:example}, the `Iterable` type
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer
interface Iterable<T> {

    @Independent(hc=true)
    Iterator<T> iterator();
}
----

First, creating an iterator should never be a modifying operation on a type.
Typically, as we explore in the next section, it implies creating a subtype, static or not, of the type implementing `Iterable`.
Second, the iterator itself is independent of the fields of the implementing type, but has the ability to return its hidden content.

The loop, on a variable `list` of type implementing `Iterable<T>`, is expressed as `for(T t: list) { ... }`, and can be interpreted as

.Example {counter:example}, implementation of for-each using an `Iterator`
[source,java]
----
Iterator<T> it = list.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()) {
    T t = it.next();
    ...
}
----

The iterator `it` content-links to `list`; via the `next` method, it content-links the hidden content of the `list` to `t`.


[#independent-type]
=== Independence of types

A concrete implementation of an iterator is often a nested type, static or not (inner class), of the iterable type:

.Example {counter:example}, implementation of an `Iterator`
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer
public class ImmutableArray<T> implements Iterable<T> {

    @NotNull(content=true)
    private final T[] elements;

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public ImmutableArray(List<T> input) {
        this.elements = (T[]) input.toArray();
    }

    @Override
    @Independent(hc=true)
    public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        return new IteratorImpl();
    }

    @Container
    @Independent(hc=true)
    class IteratorImpl implements Iterator<T> {
        private int i;

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return i < elements.length;
        }

        @Override
        @NotNull
        public T next() {
            return elements[i++];
        }
    }
}
----

For `ImmutableArray` to be immutable, the `iterator()` method must be independent of the field `elements`, in other words, the `IteratorImpl` object must not expose the `ImmutableArray` 's fields to the outside world.
It cannot be immutable itself, because it needs to hold the state of the iterator.
However, it should protect the fields owned by its enclosing type, up to the same standard as required
for immutability.

We propose to add a definition for the independence of a type, identical to the "shielding off" part of the definition of immutability.
Let's first go there in a roundabout way:

****
*Definition*: an *external modification* is a modification, carried out outside the type,

. on a field, directly accessed from the object, or
. on an argument or return value, executed after the constructor or method call on the object.
****

Clearly, such external modifications are only possible when the constructor, method or field is non-private.

Armed with this definition, we can define the independence of types:

****
*Definitions*:

A type is *dependent* when external modifications impact the accessible content of the type.

A type is *independent*, annotated {independent}, when external modifications cannot impact the accessible content of the type.
The hidden content of the type is mutable or modifiable.
****

This definition is entirely equivalent to the definition of immutability without rules 0 and 1, and rules 2
and 3 restricted to those fields that are 'exposed' to the outside world via linking or content linking.

Consider the static variant of `IteratorImpl`, which makes it more obvious that `IteratorImpl` maintains a reference
to the element array of its enclosing type:

.Example {counter:example}, implementation of an `Iterator` as a static nested type
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer
public class ImmutableArray<T> implements Iterable<T> {
    ...

    @Container
    @Independent(hc=true)
    static class IteratorImpl implements Iterator<T> {
        @Modified
        private int i;

        private final T[] elements;

        private IteratorImpl(T[] elements) {
            this.elements = elements;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return i < elements.length;
        }

        @Override
        @NotNull
        @Modified
        public T next() {
            return elements[i++];
        }
    }
}
----

The type `T` is part of the hidden content, the `T[]` and the counter `i` are part of the accessible content.
No external modification can impact the array or the counter; indeed, only `T` and a `boolean` are exposed.
The latter is immutable, so does not allow modifications.
The former allows modifications on the hidden content, whence the {independentHc} annotation for `IteratorImpl`.

Immutable types are independent as a type, but a type does not even have to be immutable to be independent.
In fact, any type communicating via immutable types to the outside world is independent:

.Example {counter:example}, simple getter and setter, independent
[source,java]
----
@Independent
@Container
class GetterSetter {
    private int i;

    public int getI() {
        return i;
    }

    public void setI(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }
}
----

The following table summarizes the relationship between immutability and independence by means of example types:

|===
| |Mutable, modifiable |Immutable with hidden content |Immutable without hidden content

|Dependent
|{y} `Set`
|{n}
|{n}

|Independent with hidden content
|{y} `Iterator<T>`
|{y} `Optional<T>`, `Set.of(T)`
|{n}

|Independent
|{y} `Writer`, `Iterator<String>`
|{n}
|{y} `int`, `String`, `Class`
