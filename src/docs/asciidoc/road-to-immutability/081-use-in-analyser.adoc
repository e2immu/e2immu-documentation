=== Support classes in the analyser

Practice what you preach, and all that.
The {e2immu} analyser relies heavily on support classes such as `SetOnce`, and on the builder pattern described in the previous section.
Almost all public types are containers.
Because we intend to use the analyser's code as a showcase for this project, one important class (`ExpressionContext`) was intentionally kept as a non-container.

A good example of our aim for eventual immutability is `TypeInfo`, the primary container holding a type.
Initially, a type is nothing but a reference, with a fully qualified name.
Source code or byte code inspection augments it with information about its methods and fields.
Whilst during inspection information is writable, after inspection this information becomes immutable.
We use the builder pattern for `TypeInspection`, using `TypeInspectionImpl.Builder` first and `TypeInspectionImpl` later.
The inspection information is stored using `SetOnce`:

.Example {counter:example}, explaining `org.e2immu.analyser.model.TypeInfo`
[source,java]
----
public class TypeInfo {
    public final String fullyQualifiedName;
    public final SetOnce<TypeInspection> typeInspection = new SetOnce<>();
    ...
}
----

Once inspection is over, the code analyser takes over.
Results are temporarily stored in `TypeAnalysisImpl.Builder`, then copied into the immutable `TypeAnalysisImpl` class.
Both classes implement the `TypeAnalysis` interface to shield off the build phase.
Once the immutable type is ready, it is stored in `TypeInfo`:

.Example {counter:example}, explaining `org.e2immu.analyser.model.TypeInfo`
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer(after="typeAnalysis,typeInspection")
public class TypeInfo {
    public final String fullyQualifiedName;

    public final SetOnce<TypeInspection> typeInspection = new SetOnce<>();
    public final SetOnce<TypeAnalysis> typeAnalysis = new SetOnce<>();

    ...
}
----

In this way, if we keep playing by the book recursively downward, `TypeInfo` will become an eventually immutable type.
Software engineers writing applications which use the {e2immu} analyser as a library, can feel secure that once the
analysis phase is over, all the inspected and analysed information remains stable.
