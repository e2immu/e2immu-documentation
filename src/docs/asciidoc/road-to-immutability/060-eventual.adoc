== Eventual immutability

In this section we explore types which follow a two-phase life cycle: the start off as mutable, then somehow become immutable.

=== Builders

We start with the well-established _builder_ paradigm.

.Example {counter:example}, static nested builder type
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer
class Point {
    public final double x;
    public final double y;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

@ImmutableContainer
class Polygon {

    @ImmutableContainer
    public final List<Point> points;

    private Polygon(List<Point> points) { // <1>
        this.points = points;
    }

    @FinalFields(builds=Polygon.class)
    static class Builder {

        @Modified
        private final List<Point> points = new ArrayList<>();

        @Modified
        public void addPoint(Point point) {
            points.add(point);
        }

        @NotModified
        public Polygon build() {
            return new Polygon(List.copyOf(points));
        }
    }
}

<1> The private constructor combined with the construction of an immutable copy in the `build` method guarantees immutability.

If your code can live with two different types (`Polygon.Builder`, `Polygon`) to represent polygons in their different stages (mutable, immutable), the builder paradigm is great.
If, on the other hand, you want to hold polygons in a type that spans both stages of the polygon lifecycle, it becomes difficult to do this with an eye on immutability.
One solution is the use of an interface that is implemented both by the builder and the immutable type.

The <<support-firstthen>> type can also assist in this situation: it holds an initial object (the _first_) until a state change occurs, and it is forced to hold a second object (the _then_).
Once it is in the final state, it cannot change anymore.
It is _eventually immutable_:

.Example {counter:example}, use of `FirstThen` to make a type eventually immutable
[source,java]
----
class PolygonManager {
    // initially, the polygon is in builder phase
    public final FirstThen<Polygon.Builder, Polygon> polygon =
        new FirstThen<>(new Polygon.Builder());

    // ...

    public void construct() {
        // in builder phase ...
        polygon.getFirst().add(point);
        // transition
        polygon.set(polygon.getFirst().build());
        // from here on, polygon is immutable!
    }

    public Point firstPoint() {
        return polygon.get().points.get(0);
    }
}

=== Definition

We propose a system of eventual immutability based on a single transition of state inside an object.

.Example {counter:example}, state change in a boolean field
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer(after="frozen")
class SimpleImmutableSet1<T> {
    private final Set<T> set = new HashSet<>();
    private boolean frozen;

    @Only(before="frozen")
    public boolean add(T t) {
        if(frozen) throw new IllegalStateException();
        set.add(t);
    }

    @Mark("frozen")
    public void freeze() {
        if(frozen) throw new IllegalStateException();
        frozen = true;
    }

    @Only(after="frozen")
    public Stream<T> stream() {
        if(!frozen) throw new IllegalStateException();
        return set.stream();
    }

    @TestMark("frozen")
    public boolean isFrozen() { // <1>
        return frozen;
    }

    public int size() { // <1>
        return set.size();
    }
}
----

<1> These methods can be called any time.

The analyser has no problem detecting the presence of preconditions, and observing that one method changes its own precondition.
The rules, however, are sufficiently general to support arbitrary preconditions, as shown in the following variant.
This example does not require an additional field, but relies on the empty/not-empty state change:

.Example {counter:example}, state change going from empty to non-empty
[source,java]
----
@ImmutableContainer(after="set")
class SimpleImmutableSet2<T> {
    private final Set<T> set = new HashSet<>();

    @Mark("set")
    public void initialize(Set<T> data) {
        if(!set.isEmpty()) throw new IllegalStateException();
        if(data.isEmpty()) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        set.addAll(data);
    }

    @Only(after="set")
    public Stream<T> stream() {
        if(set.isEmpty()) throw new IllegalStateException();
        return set.stream();
    }

    public int size() {
        return set.size();
    }

    @TestMark("set")
    public boolean hasBeenInitialised() {
        return !set.isEmpty();
    }
}
----

Let us summarize the annotations:

* The {mark} annotation marks methods that change the state from _before_ to _after_.
* The {only} annotation identifies methods that, because of their precondition, can only be executed without raising an exception before (when complemented with a `before="..."` parameter) or after (with a `after="..."` parameter) the transition.
* The analyser computes the {testMark} annotation on methods which return the state as a boolean.
There is a parameter to indicate that instead of returning `true` when the object is _after_, the method actually returns `true` on _before_.
* Finally, the eventuality of the type shows in the `after="..."` parameter of {finalFields}, {immutable} or the shorthand {immutableContainer}.

In each of these annotations, the actual value of the `...` in the `after=` or `before=` parameters is the name of the field.

In case there are multiple fields involved, their names are represented in a comma-separated fashion.

The {mark} and {only} annotations can also be assigned to parameters, in the event that marked methods are called on a parameter of eventually immutable type.
Consider the following utility method for <<support-eventuallyfinal>>, frequently used in the analyser:

.Example {counter:example}, utility method for `EventuallyFinal`
[source,java]
----
public static <T> void setFinalAllowEquals(
        @Mark("isFinal") EventuallyFinal<T> eventuallyFinal, T t) {
    if (eventuallyFinal.isVariable() || !Objects.equals(eventuallyFinal.get(), t)) {
        eventuallyFinal.setFinal(t);
    }
}
----

Here, the `setFinal` method's {mark} annotation travels to the parameter, where it is applied to the argument each time the static method is applied.

=== Propagation

The support types detailed in <<support-classes>> can be used as building blocks to make ever more complex eventually immutable classes.
Effectively final fields of eventually immutable type will at some point hold objects that are in their final or `after` state, in which case they act as immutable fields.

The analyser itself consists of many eventually immutable classes; we show some examples in <<in-the-analyser>>.

IMPORTANT: For everyday use of eventual immutability, this is probably the most important consequence of all definitions up to now.

=== Before the mark

A method can return an eventually immutable object, guaranteed to be in its initial or `before` state.
This can be annotated with {beforeMark}.
Employing `SimpleImmutableSet1` from the example above,

.Example {counter:example}, `@BeforeMark` annotation
[source,java]
----
@BeforeMark
public SimpleImmutableSet1 create() {
    return new SimpleImmutableSet1();
}
----

Similarly, the analyser can compute a parameter to be {beforeMark}, when in the method, at least one before-mark methods is called on the parameter.

Finally, a field can even be {beforeMark}, when it is created or arrives in the type as {beforeMark}, and stays in this state.
This situation must occur in a type with a {finalizer}, as explained in <<finalizers>>.

=== Extensions of annotations

When a type is eventually level 1 immutable, should the field(s) of the state transition be {variable} or {final}?
Similarly, when a type is eventually immutable, should the analyser mark the initially mutable or assignable fields {modified} or {nm}?

Basically, we propose to mark with the end state, qualifying with the parameter `after`:

[options=header]
|===
| property | not present | eventually | effectively
| finality of field | {variable} | `@Final(after="mark")` | {final}
| non-modification of field | {modified} | `@NotModified(after="mark")` | {nm}
|===

Since in an IDE it is not too easy to have multiple visual markers, it seems best to use the same visuals as the end state.

When a type is effectively level 1 immutable (not eventually), all fields are effectively final.
The analyser wants to emphasise the rules needed to obtain (eventual) immutability, by clearly indicating which fields break the immutability rules.

Eventual finality simply adds a `@Final(after="mark")` annotation to each of these situations.

=== Frameworks and contracts

A fair number of Java frameworks introduce dependency injection and initializer methods.
This concept is, in many cases, compatible with the idea of eventual immutability: once dependency injection has taken place, and an initializing method has been called, the framework stops intervening in the value of the fields.

It is therefore not difficult to imagine, and implement in the analyser, a _before_ state (initialization still ongoing) and an _after_ state (initialization done) associated with the particular framework.
The example below shows how this could be done for the `Verticle` interface of the https://vertx.io[vertx.io framework^].

.Example {counter:example}, excerpts and annotations of `Verticle.java` and `AbstractVerticle.java`
[source]
----
@FinalFields(after = "init")
interface Verticle {

    @Mark("init")
    void init(Vertx vertx, Context context);

    @Only(after = "init")
    Vertx getVertx();

    @Only(after = "init")
    void start(Promise<Void> startPromise) throws Exception;

    @Only(after = "init")
    void stop(Promise<Void> startPromise) throws Exception;
}

public abstract class AbstractVerticle implements Verticle {
    @Final(after="init")
    protected Vertx vertx;

    @Final(after="init")
    protected Context context;

    @Override
    public Vertx getVertx() {
        return vertx;
    }

    @Override
    public void init(Vertx vertx, Context context) {
        this.vertx = vertx;
        this.context = context;
    }
    ...
}

Currently, mid 2021, contracted eventual immutability has not been implemented yet in the analyser.
