== Modification

****
*Definition*: a *method is modifying* if it causes an assignment in the object graph of the fields of the object it is applied to.
****

We use the term 'object graph' to denote the fields of the object, the fields of these fields, etc., to arbitrary depth.

Consequently, a method is not modifying if it only reads from the object graph of the fields.
The analyser uses the annotations {nm} and {modified}.
They are exclusive, and the analyser will compute one or the other for every method of the type.
All non-trivial constructors are modifying, so we avoid clutter by not annotating them.

NOTE: Why not `@Modifying` and `@NotModifying`? The analyser will compute modifications of fields and parameters as well. They will either be _modified_ or _not modified_ by the code. To avoid
confusion, we only use one set of annotations. This is the only occurrence of a pair of diametrically opposed annotations.

It follows from the definition that directly assigning to the fields also causes the {modified} mark for methods.
As a consequence, setters are {modified}, while getters are {nm}.
Consider:

.Example {counter:example}, modifying and non-modifying methods
[source,java]
----
class Counter {
    // variable
    private int counter;

    @NotModified
    public int getCounter() {
        return counter;
    }

    @Modified
    public int increment() {
        counter += 1;
        return counter;
    }
}

@FinalFields
class CountedInfo {
    @Modified
    private final Counter counter = new Counter();

    @Modified
    public void printInfo(String info) {
        System.out.println("Message " + counter.increment() + ": "+info);
    }
}
----

We also see in the example that the `printInfo` method is {modified}.
This is because it calls a modifying method on one of the fields: `increment`.

Moving from methods to parameters and fields, keeping the same two annotations,

****
*Definition*:
The analyser marks a *parameter* as *modified* when the parameter's method applies an assignment or modifying methods on the object that enters the method via the parameter.
This definition holds with respect to the parameter's entire object graph.
****

We will apply a similar reasoning to a field:

****
*Definition*:
The analyser marks a *field* as *modified* when at least one of the type's methods, transitively reachable from a non-private non-constructor method, applies at least one assignment to or modifying method on this field.
****

Let us start by agreeing that the methods of `Object` and `String` are all {nm}.
This is pretty obvious in the case of `toString`, `hashCode`, `getClass`.
It is less obvious for the `wait` and other synchronization-related methods, but remember that as discussed in the <<assumptions>>, we exclude synchronization support from this discussion.

Note also that we cannot add modifying methods to the type `DeeplyImmutable1` defined <<deeply-immutable1,earlier>>.

Proceeding, let us also look at (a part of) the `Collection` interface, where we've restricted the annotations to {nm} and {modified}.
An abstract method without {modified} is assumed to be non-modifying, i.e., {nm} is implicitly present.
(The reason for this choice is explained later, in <<abstract-methods>>.) While in normal classes the analyser computes the annotations, in interfaces the user stipulates or _contracts_ behaviour by annotating:

.Example {counter:example}, [[collection-interface]] modification aspects of the `Collection` interface
[source,java]
----
public interface Collection<E> extends Iterable<E> {
    @Modified
    boolean add(E e);

    @Modified
    boolean addAll(@NotModified Collection<? extends E> collection);

    boolean contains(Object object);

    boolean containsAll(@NotModified Collection<?> c);

    void forEach(Consumer<? super E> action);

    boolean isEmpty();

    @Modified
    boolean remove(Object object);

    @Modified
    boolean removeAll(@NotModified Collection<?> c);

    int size();

    Stream<E> stream();

    Object[] toArray();
}
----

Adding an object to a collection (set, list) will cause some assignment somewhere inside the data structure.
Returning the size of the collection should not.

IMPORTANT: Under supervision of the analyser, you will not be able to create an implementation of this interface which violates the modification rules.
This is intentional: no implementation should modify the data structure when `size` is called.

Adding all elements of a collection to the object (in `addAll`) should not modify the input collection, whence the {nm}.
Other types in the parameters have not been annotated with {nm}:

* `Object` because it is immutable;
* `E` because it is of an unbound generic type, it has the same methods available as `Object`.
No code statically visible to implementations of `Collection` can make modifications to `E`;
* `Consumer` because it is a functional interface (an interface with a single abstract method) in `java.util.function`; they are {ignoreModifications} by convention, as explained later.

In order to keep the narrative going, we defer a discussion of modification in the context of parameters of abstract types to the sections
<<abstract-methods>> and <<hidden-content>>.
Here, we continue with the first use case of modification: containers.
