== Containers

Loosely speaking, a container is a type to which you can safely pass on your objects, it will not modify them.
This is the formal rule:

****
*Definition*: a type is a *container* when no non-private method or constructor modifies its arguments.
****

Whatever else the container does, storing the arguments in fields or not, it will not change the objects
you pass to it.
You obviously remain free to change them elsewhere; then the container may hold on to the changed object.

NOTE: We will use the term _argument_ to denote the value passed to a _parameter_.
The latter is the variable, bound to a specific method, that receives this value.

Containers are complementary to immutable objects, and we will find that many immutable objects are containers,
while some containers are the precursors to immutable types.
There are two archetypes for containers: collections and builders.

The simple but useful utility type `Pair` trivially satisfies the container requirements:

.Example {counter:example}, a `Pair` of objects
[source,java]
----
@Container
public class Pair<K,V> {
    public final K k;
    public final V v;

    public Pair(K k, V v) {
        this.k = k;
        this.v = v;
    }

    public K getK() {
        return k;
    }

    public V getV() {
        return v;
    }
}
----

While its fields are clearly final, it will remain to be seen if it satisfies all criteria for intuitive immutability.
However, it is easily recognized as a container: a type you use and trust to hold objects.

Containers occur frequently as static nested types to build immutable objects.
Examples of these will follow later, after the definition of immutability.

In the following example, the first class is computed to be a container, the second is a container according to the
contract, and the third is a class which cannot be a container:

.Example {counter:example}, two containers and a type that is not a container
[source,java]
----
@Container
class ErrorMessage {
    // variable
    private String message;

    public ErrorMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @NotModified
    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }

    @Modified
    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }
}

@Container
interface ErrorRegistry {
    // @NotModified implicitly
    List<ErrorMessage> getErrors();

    @Modified
    void addError(@NotModified ErrorMessage errorMessage); // <1>
}

class BinaryExpression extends Expression {
    public final Expression lhs;
    public final Expression rhs;

    // ...

    public void evaluate(@Modified ErrorRegistry errorRegistry) {
        // ...
        if(lhs instanceof NullConstant || rhs instanceof NullConstant) {
            errorRegistry.addError(new ErrorMessage(...)); // <2>
        }
        // ...
    }
}
----

<1> Implementations of `ErrorRegistry` will not be allowed to use the `setMessage` setter in `addError`, or in any
other method not mentioned here, if the `errorMessage` has been assigned or added to any of the fields.
<2> Here a modifying method call takes place.

The `BinaryExpression` class is not a container, because it uses one of the parameters of a public method,
`errorRegistry` of `evaluate`, as a writable container.

Arrays are essentially containers holding the {finalFields} property: a chunk of memory is held in an effectively final
field, and array access reads and writes from this memory object.
Indeed, consider the following semi-realistic implementation of an `Integer` array based on a `ByteBuffer`:

.Example {counter:example}, an array is a container with final fields
[source,java]
----
@Container
interface Array<T> {
    int length();

    T get(int index);

    @Modified
    void set(int index, T t);
}

@FinalFields @Container
static class IntArray implements Array<Integer> {
    private final ByteBuffer byteBuffer;
    private final int size;

    public IntArray(int size) {
        this.size = size;
        byteBuffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(new byte[size * Integer.BYTES]);
    }

    @Override
    public int length() {
        return size;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer get(int index) {
        return byteBuffer.getInt(index * Integer.BYTES);
    }

    @Override
    @Modified
    public void set(int index, Integer i) {
        byteBuffer.putInt(index * Integer.BYTES, i);
    }
}

@Test
public void test() {
    IntArray ia = new IntArray(5);
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) ia.set(i, i + 1);
    assertEquals(3, ia.get(2));
}
----

It would have been better to show an `ErrorMessage` array, because, contrary to `Integer`, the former is
mutable (it has a modifying method `setMessage`). The technical aspect of storing and
retrieving the reference to the object, which is not normally available, prevents us from doing this here.

To conclude this section, note that the definition of `@Container` carefully words
_... modifies its arguments_. This is almost equivalent
to ensuring that all non-private methods have all their parameters marked as {nm}. However, under those
conditions, it is still possible to change the object graph of the arguments, as the following example shows:

.Example {counter:example}, an instance where {nm} on the parameters is not enough to ensure {container}
[source,java]
----
class ErrorRegistry {
    private final List<ErrorMessage> messages = new ArrayList<>();

    @Modified
    public void add(@NotModified ErrorMessage message) {
        messages.add(message);
    }

    @Modified
    public void changeFirst() {
        if(!messages.isEmpty()) {
            messages.get(0).setMessage("changed!");
        }
    }
}
----

Here, objects passed on to the `ErrorRegistry` are not modified by the `add` method, but they may be modified later
by a call to the `changeFirst` method, violating the idea that _all objects passed to the container are safe
from modification_.
The analyser will need to guard against this; and its tool to this end is _linking_.
