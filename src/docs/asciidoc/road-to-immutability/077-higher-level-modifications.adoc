== Higher-level modifications

From a type's point of view, fields are either of an explicit type, they are accessible, or they are of implicitly immutable type, in other words, replaceable by `Object` and inaccessible.
Our focus up to now has been on modification of the explicit types: we have argued that they are the only ones that matter for practical immutability.
Now we will try to characterise modifications that are beyond the scope of the type.

Please note that characterising _all_ modifications is a hopelessly complex, and unnecessary, task.
We will, however, need to deal with what can be seen as the first level of higher level modifications, if we want to be able to characterise the modifications going on in extremely important constructs such as iterators.

=== Propagating modifications

The basis of this section is an example container class called `Circular`:

.First methods of Circular
[source,java]
----
@Container
class Circular<T> {

    private T x;
    private T y;
    private boolean next;

    public Circular() {
    }

    @Independent
    public Circular(Circular<T> c) {
        x = c.x;
        y = c.y;
        next = c.next;
    }

    @Modified
    public void add(T t) {
        if (next) {
            this.y = t;
        } else {
            this.x = t;
        }
        next = !next;
    }

    @NotModified
    @E2Container
    public Stream<T> stream() {
        return Stream.of(x, y);
    }
}
----

We also make use of the `Consumer` functional interface:

.Consumer
[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t);
}
----

Note that method and parameter remain unmarked in terms of modification.
Using the `Consumer` we introduce a `forEach` method which iterates over the two elements:

.forEach in Circular
[source,java]
----
@NotModified
public void forEach(@PropagateModification Consumer<T> consumer) {
    consumer.accept(x);
    consumer.accept(y);
}
----

From the point of view of `Circular`, no modifications occur because `accept` operates on fields of the implicitly immutable type `T`.
No modifying methods are called on the parameter `consumer`, therefore it is not modified, and `Circular` can remain a container.

How do we propagate the modification?
In this example we will use `StringBuilder` as an archetypal modifiable type.

.Propagating the modification of forEach
[source,java]
----
static void print(@NotModified @NotModified1 Circular<StringBuilder> c) {
    c.forEach(System.out::println); // <1>
}

static void addNewLine(@NotModified @Modified1 Circular<StringBuilder> c) {
    c.forEach(sb -> sb.append("\n")); // <2>
}

static void replace(@Modified @NotModified1 Circular<StringBuilder> c) {
    c.forEach(sb -> c.add(new StringBuilder("x" + sb))); // <3>
}
----
<1> non-modifying method implies no modification on the implicitly immutable content of `c`
<2> parameter-modifying lambda propagates modification to `c`'s implicitly immutable content
<3> object-modifying lambda changing `c` but not its content

We have introduced two new annotations, {m1} and {nm1}.
Their meaning is intuitively clear from the example:
the method `print` does not modify the implicitly immutable content of `Circular`, whereas the `addNewLine` method will do so.
Conversely, `replace` modifies the `Circular` parameter directly, ignoring its content.

It is clear that we make a distinction between modifying the `Circular` instance, and modifying its content, the objects of type `StringBuilder`.
Does this contradict the initial definition of modification of a parameter?
Yes, but it allows us to be more specific.

How can we use this additional firepower?
Consider the following two examples:

.Using print and addNewLine
[source,java]
----
static String usePrint(@NotModified StringBuilder sb1,
                       @NotModified StringBuilder sb2,
                       @NotModified StringBuilder sb3) {
    Circular<StringBuilder> circular = new Circular<>();
    circular.add(sb1); // <1>
    circular.add(sb2);
    circular.add(sb3);
    print(circular);
    return circular.stream().collect(Collectors.joining());
}

static String useAddNewLine(@Modified StringBuilder sb1,
                            @Modified StringBuilder sb2,
                            @Modified StringBuilder sb3) {
    Circular<StringBuilder> circular = new Circular<>();
    circular.add(sb1);
    circular.add(sb2);
    circular.add(sb3);
    addNewLine(circular); // <2>
    return circular.stream().collect(Collectors.joining());
}
----
<1> `circular` now holds `sb1`
<2> {m1} implies that the elements held by circular are modified (but not circular itself)

Proper propagation of the modifications relies on knowing that `circular` holds the parameters `sb1`, `sb2` and `sb3`.
(We will assume it is too complicated to assess whether `sb1` is still held by `circular` or not.) This will be accomplished by computing 'content links', which give rise to 'content (in)dependence', all in a way very similar to ordinary linking and (in)dependence.

[#content-linking]
=== Content linking

Going back to `Circular`, we see that the `add` method binds the parameter `t` to the instance by means of assignment.
Let us call this binding of parameters of implicitly immutable types _content linking_, and mark it using {dependent1}, _content dependence_:

.Extra annotation on add
[source,java]
----
@Modified
public void add(@Dependent1 T t) {
    if (next) {
        this.y = t;
    } else {
        this.x = t;
    }
    next = !next;
}
----

Note that content dependence implies normal independence, exactly because we are dealing with parameters of implicitly immutable type.
Thanks to this annotation, the statement `circular.add(sb1)` can content link `sb1` to circular.
When propagating the modification of `addNewLine`'s parameter, all variables content linked to the argument get marked.

A second way, next to assignment, of adding to content links is Java's for-each loop:

.For-each loop and content linking
[source,java]
----
Collection<StringBuilder> builders = ...;
for(StringBuilder sb: builders) { circular.add(sb); }
----

The local loop variable `sb` gets content linked to `circular`.
Crucially, however, it is not difficult to see that `sb` is also content linked to `builders`!
The `Collection` API will contain an `add` method annotated as:

[source,java]
----
@Modified
boolean add(@NotNull @Dependent1 E e) { return true; }
----

indicating that after calling `add`, the argument will become part of the implicitly immutable content of the collection.
We need yet another annotation, {dependent2}, to indicate that the implicitly immutable content of two objects are linked.
Looking at a possible implementation of `addAll`:

.addAll
[source,java]
----
@Modified
boolean addAll(@NotNull1 @Dependent2 Collection<? extends E> collection) {
    boolean modified = false;
    for (E e : c) if (add(e)) modified = true;
    return modified;
}
----

The call to `add` content links `e` to `this`.
Because `e` is also content linked to `c`, the parameter `collection`
holds implicitly immutable content linked to the implicitly immutable content of the instance.

Again, note that {dependent2} implies independence, because it deals with the implicitly immutable content.

We're now properly armed to see how a for-each loop can be defined as an iterator whose implicitly immutable content links to that of a container.

=== Iterator, Iterable, loops

Let us start with the simplest definition of an iterator, without `remove` method:

.Iterator, without remove
[source,java]
----
interface Iterator<T> {

    @Modified
    @Dependent1
    T next();

    @Modified
    boolean hasNext();
}
----

Either the `next` method, or the `hasNext` method, must make a change to the iterator, because it has to keep track of the next element.
As such, we make both {modified}.
Following the discussion in the previous section, `next` is {dependent1}, because it returns part of the implicitly immutable content held by the iterator.

The interface `Iterable` is a supplier of iterators:

.Iterable
[source,java]
----
interface Iterable<T> {

    @NotModified
    @Dependent2
    Iterator<T> iterator();
}
----

First, creating an iterator should never be a modifying operation on a type.
Typically, as we explore in the next section, it implies creating a sub-type, static or not, of the type implementing `Iterable`.
Secondly, the iterator itself is independent of the fields of the implementing type, but has the ability to return its implicitly immutable content.

The loop, on a variable `list` of type implementing `Iterable<T>`,

[source,java]
----
for(T t: list) { ... }
----

can be interpreted as

[source,java]
----
Iterator<T> iterator = list.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()) {
    T t = it.next();
    ...
}
----

The iterator is {dependent2}.
Via the `next` method, it content-links the implicitly immutable content of the `list` to `t`.

=== Independence of types

A concrete implementation of an iterator is a sub-type, static or not, of the iterable type:

[source,java]
----
@E2Container
public class ImmutableArray<T> implements Iterable<T> {

    @NotNull1
    private final T[] elements;

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public ImmutableArray(List<T> input) {
        this.elements = (T[]) input.toArray();
    }

    @Override
    @Independent
    public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        return new IteratorImpl();
    }

    @Container
    @Independent
    class IteratorImpl implements Iterator<T> {
        private int i;

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return i < elements.length;
        }

        @Override
        @NotNull
        public T next() {
            return elements[i++];
        }
    }
}
----

For `ImmutableArray` to be level 2 immutable, the `iterator()` method must be independent of the field `elements`.
How do we know this?
The implementation type `IteratorImpl` cannot be level 2 immutable, because it needs to hold the state of the iterator.
However, it should protect the fields of its enclosing type.
We propose to add a definition for the independence of a type, very similar to the one enforced for level 2 immutability:

****
*Definition*: A type is *independent* when it follows these three rules:

*Rule 1*: All constructor parameters linked to fields, and therefore all fields linked to constructor parameters, must be {nm};

*Rule 2*: All fields linked to constructor parameters must be either private or level 2 immutable;

*Rule 3*: All return values of methods must be independent of the fields linked to constructor parameters.
****

The static variant of `IteratorImpl` makes rules 1 and 2 more obvious:

.Static iterator implementation
[source,java]
----
@E2Container
public class ImmutableArray<T> implements Iterable<T> {
    ...

    @Container
    @Independent
    static class IteratorImpl implements Iterator<T> {
        private int i;
        private final T[] elements;

        private IteratorImpl(T[] elements) {
            this.elements = elements;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return i < elements.length;
        }

        @Override
        @NotNull
        public T next() {
            return elements[i++];
        }
    }
}
----

=== Extending implicitly immutable types

Looking at the <<support-lazy>> example, which immutability properties should we give the field `Supplier<T> supplier`?
The type `T` is implicitly immutable in `Lazy`, as it can be replaced by `java.lang.Object`.
We propose to add abstract types, where _only_ the abstract method is called, to the set of implicitly immutable types of the enclosing type.
