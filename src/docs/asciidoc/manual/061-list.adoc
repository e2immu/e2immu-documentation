=== List of annotations

For each of the annotations, we answer a couple of standard questions:

Basic:: is this an annotation you definitely should understand?
Immu:: is this annotation part of the immutability concept of the analyzer?
Contract:: will you manually insert this annotation often in interfaces?
Type:: does the annotation occur on types?
Field:: does the annotation occur on (static) fields?
Method:: does the annotation occur on methods and constructors?
Parameter:: does the annotation occur on parameters?

This classification hopefully helps to see the wood for the trees in the long list.

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#allowsInterrupt-annotation]
==== @AllowsInterrupt

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {n}| Contract {y}| Type {n} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {n}
|===

Contract-only annotation indicating that this method or constructor increases the statement time (<<concept-statement-time>>), or allows the execution to be interrupted.

Default value is true.
Methods can be annotated with `@AllowsInterrupt(false)` to explicitly mark that they do not interrupt.

External methods not annotated will not interrupt.

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#beforeMark-annotation]
==== @BeforeMark

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {n} | Field {y} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: Annotation computed when an eventually immutable type is guaranteed to be in its _before_ state, i.e., none of the marked methods have been called yet.
As a dynamic type annotation (<<technical-dynamic-type-annotations>>), it is the opposite of {e1immutable},
{e2immutable}, or its container variants {e1container}, {e2container}.
They guarantee that an eventually immutable object is in its _after_ state, i.e., a marked method has been called, and the object has become immutable.

Mode:: not immediately relevant

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#constant-annotation]
==== @Constant

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {n}| Contract {n}| Type {n} | Field {y} | Method {y} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: The analyser emits this annotation when a field has a constant final value, or a method returns a constant value.
Its primary purpose is to help debug the analyser.
More details in <<concept-constant>>.

Mode:: This annotation has no opposite.

Example:: In this simple example, an `enum` constant is returned by the `highest` method:

[source,java]
----
@E2Container
public enum Enum_3 {
    ONE(1), TWO(2), THREE(3);

    public final int cnt;

    Enum_3(int cnt) {
        this.cnt = cnt;
    }

    @Constant("THREE")
    public static Enum_3 highest() {
        return THREE;
    }
}
----

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#container-annotation]
==== @Container

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {y} | Field {n} | Method {n} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: The analyser computes this essential annotation for types which do not modify the parameters of their constructors and non-private methods.
See <<concept-containers>> for an in-depth discussion.

Mode:: Use this annotation in green mode.
The opposite is {mutableModifiesArguments} if the type has {variable} fields, or {e1immutable} if all the type's fields are effectively final.

Example::
The following examples present containers: <<constant-annotation>>, <<dependent-annotation>>, <<e1container-annotation>>.
Non-containers are in <<e1immutable-annotation>> and <<mutableModifiesArguments-annotation>>.

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#dependent-annotation]
==== @Dependent

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {y} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: Annotation used to indicate that the type's fields <<concept-linking,link>> to the method's parameter or return value, or the constructor's parameters.
This annotation is only present for fields that are not of <<concept-implicitly-immutable,implicitly immutable type>>.
Additionally, on methods, the analyser only computes the annotation when the method is {nm}.

Mode:: Use this annotation in the red mode.
Its opposite is {independent}.

Example::

The assignment of a mutable set to a field typically causes a dependency:

[source,java]
----
class Dependent<String> {
    private final Set<String> set;

    public Dependent(@Dependent Set<String> set) {
        this.set = set;
    }

    @Dependent
    public Set<String> getSet() {
        return set;
    }
}
----

A similar example is in <<e1immutable-annotation>>.

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#dependent1-annotation]
==== @Dependent1

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {n} | Contract {n}| Type {n} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: As one of the <<concept-higher-order-modification>> annotations, {dependent1}
on a parameter, of <<concept-implicitly-immutable,implicitly immutable type>>, indicates that this parameter is assigned to one of the fields, or assigned into the object graph of one of the fields.
When computed on a method, the return value of the method, again of implicitly immutable type, is known to be part of the object graph of the fields.

Mode:: This annotation has no opposite.
It implies {independent} because it appears on implicitly immutable types only.

Example:: This annotation has been contracted in many collection-framework methods, such as

[source,java]
----
Collections.add(@Dependent1 E e);

@Dependent1
E List.get(int index);
----

The most direct example explaining the definition is:

[source,java]
----
public class Dependent1_0<T> {
    @Linked1(to = {"Dependent1_0:t"})
    private final T t;

    public Dependent1_0(@Dependent1 T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    @Dependent1
    public T getT() {
        return t;
    }
}
----

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#dependent2-annotation]
==== @Dependent2

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {n} | Contract {n} | Type {n} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: This annotation is one of the <<concept-higher-order-modification>> annotations.
It is only computed for <<concept-linking,independent>> parameters or methods.
When computed on a parameter, it indicates that part of the <<concept-implicitly-immutable,implicitly immutable content>>
of the argument will be assigned to the fields of the method's type.
When computed on a method, it signifies that part of the implicitly immutable content of the return value is assigned to the fields of the method's type.

This annotation is central to iteration over the implicitly immutable content of a type.

Mode:: This annotation has no opposite.
By definition, implies {independent}.

Example:: This annotation has been contracted in many collection-framework methods, such as

[source,java]
----
boolean Collections.addAll(@Dependent2 Collection<? extends E> coll);

@Dependent2
Stream<E> Collections.stream();
----

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#e1container-annotation]
==== @E1Container

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {y} | Field {y} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: This annotation is a short-hand for the combination of {e1immutable} and {container}, as described in <<concept-e1immutable>> and <<concept-containers>>.

Mode:: This annotation sits in between {mutableModifiesArguments}, {container} and {e2container}.

Example:: In the following example of an eventually level 1 immutable type, the field `j` remains variable until the user of the class calls `setPositiveJ`.

.Example of an eventually @E1Container type
[source,java]
----
@E1Container(after = "j")
class EventuallyE1Immutable_2_M {

    @Modified
    private final Set<Integer> integers = new HashSet<>();

    @Final(after = "j")
    private int j;

    @Modified
    @Only(after = "j")
    public boolean addIfGreater(int i) {
        if (this.j <= 0) throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Not yet set");
        if (i >= this.j) {
            integers.add(i);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    @NotModified
    public Set<Integer> getIntegers() {
        return integers;
    }

    @NotModified
    public int getJ() {
        return j;
    }

    @Modified
    @Mark("j")
    public void setPositiveJ(int j) {
        if (j <= 0) throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        if (this.j > 0) throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Already set");

        this.j = j;
    }

    @Modified
    @Only(before = "j")
    public void setNegativeJ(int j) {
        if (j > 0) throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        if (this.j > 0) throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Already set");
        this.j = j;
    }

[#e1immutable-annotation]
==== @E1Immutable

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {y} | Field {y} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that a type is <<concept-e1immutable,level 1 immutable>>, effectively or eventually, meaning all fields are effectively or eventually final.
Mode:: This annotation sits in between {mutableModifiesArguments} and {e2immutable}.

Example:: The `add` method modifies its parameter `input`; at the same time, the dependence between the constructor's parameter and the field prevents the type from being level 2 immutable:

[source,java]
----
@E1Immutable
class AddToSet {
    private final Set<String> stringsToAdd;

    @Dependent
    public AddToSet(Set<String> set) {
        this.stringsToAdd = set;
    }

    public void add(@Modified @NotNull1 Set<String> input) {
        input.addAll(set);
    }
}
----

[#e2container-annotation]
==== @E2Container

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {y} | Field {y} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: This annotation is a short-hand for the combination of {e2immutable} and {container}, as described in <<concept-e2immutable>> and <<concept-containers>>.

Mode:: This annotation is the default in the red mode.

Example::

[#e2immutable-annotation]
==== @E2Immutable

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {y} | Field {y} | Method {y} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that a type is level 2 immutable, effectively or eventually.

Mode:: This annotation is the default in the red mode.

Details:: Level 2 immutability adds extra restrictions on top of level 1 immutability:

. all fields must be {nm};
. all fields must be either private, level 2 immutable, or of implicitly immutable type;
. all non-private methods and constructors must be marked {independent}

[#final-annotation]
==== @Final

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {n}| Type {n} | Field {y} | Method {n} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that a field is effectively or eventually final.
Fields that have the Java modifier `final` possess the annotation, but the analyser does not write it out to avoid clutter.

Mode:: Use this annotation to contract in the green mode, with the opposite, {variable}, being the default.
In the red mode, {final} is the default.

Parameters::
The `after="mark"` parameter indicates that the field is eventually final, after the marking method.

Details:: A field is effectively final when no method, transitively reachable from a non-private non-constructor method, assigns to the field.
A field is eventually final if the above definition holds when one excludes all the methods that are pre-marking, i.e., that hold an annotation `@Only(before="mark")` or `@Mark("mark")`.

Example::
Please find an example of an eventually final field in the example of <<e1container-annotation>>.

.Example for @Variable, @Final
[source,java]
----
@Container
class ExampleManualVariableFinal {

    @Final
    private int i;

    @Variable
    private int j;

    public final int k; // <1>

    public ExampleManualVariableFinal(int p, int q) {
        setI(p);
        this.k = q;
    }

    @NotModified
    public int getI() {
        return i;
    }

    @Modified // <2>
    private void setI(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }

    @NotModified
    public int getJ() {
        return j;
    }

    @Modified
    public void setJ(int j) {
        this.j = j;
    }

==== @Fluent

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {n}| Contract {y}| Type {n} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that a method returns `this`, allowing for method chaining.
Mode:: There is no opposite for this annotation.
Details:: Fluent methods do not return a real value.
This is of consequence in the definition of independence for methods, as dependence on `this` is ignored.

Example::

[source,java]

@Fluent
public Builder setValue(char c) {
    this.c = c;
    return this;
}

// ********************************************************************************************************************

==== @Identity

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {n}| Contract {y}| Type {n} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that a method returns its first parameter.
Mode:: There is no opposite for this annotation.
Details:: Apart for all the obvious consequences, this annotation has an explicit effect on the linking of variables: a method marked {identity} only links to the first parameter.

Example::

[source,java]
----
@Identity
public static <T> requireNonNull(T t) {
    if(t == null) throw new NullpointerException();
    return t;

----

// ********************************************************************************************************************

==== @IgnoreModifications

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {n} | Field {y} | Method {n} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: Helper annotation to mark that modifications on a field are to be ignored, because they fall outside the scope of the application.

Mode:: There is no opposite for this annotation.
It can only be used for contracting, the analyser cannot generate it.

Example:: The only current use is on `System.out` and `System.err`.
The `print` method family is obviously modifying to these fields, however, we judge it to be outside the scope of the application.

// ********************************************************************************************************************

==== @Independent

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {n} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: Annotation used to indicate that a method or constructor avoids linking the fields of the type to the return value and parameters.
This annotation is only present when there are support data fields.
Additionally, on methods, the analyser only computes the annotation when the method is {nm}.

Mode:: Use this annotation in the green mode.
Its opposite is {dependent}.

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {y}| Type {n} | Field {y} | Method {y} | Param {y}

Mode:: It is the default in the green mode, when {nm} is not visible.

// ********************************************************************************************************************

[#mutableModifiesArguments-annotation]
==== @MutableModifiesArguments

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {n}| Type {y} | Field {n} | Method {n} | Param {n}
|===

Summary::
This annotation appears on types which are not a container and not level 1 immutable: at least one method will modify its parameters, and at least one field will be variable.
Definitions are in <<concept-containers>> and <<concept-e1immutable>>.

Mode:: It is the default in the green mode when none of {container}, {e1immutable}, {e1container}, {e2immutable}, {e2container} is present.
Use it for contracting in the red mode.

Example:: Types with non-private fields cannot be level 1 immutable.
Here we combine that with a parameter modifying method:

[source,java]
----
@MutableModifiesArguments
class Mutate {
    @Variable
    public int count;

    public void add(@Modified List<String> list) {
        for(int i=0; i<count; i++) {

[#propagateModification-annotation]
==== @PropagateModification

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {n} | Contract {n}| Type {n} | Field {y} | Method {n} | Param {y}
|===

Summary:: This annotation is part of the <<concept-higher-order-modification,higher-order modifications>>.
The analyser adds this annotation when an abstract method without modification information is called on a parameter.
This abstract method can be modifying or not, and in general it cannot be known which is the case.
The annotation then informs the analyser that modifications need computing at caller-time.
+
The annotation is also possible on fields, in case the parameter becomes the effectively final value of a field.

Mode:: There is no opposite.

Example:: A typical implementation of `forEach` is a nice example:

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t); // <1>
    ...
}
@Container
public interface Set<T> {
    default void forEach(@PropagateModification Consumer<T> consumer) {
      for(T t: this) consumer.accept(t);
    }
    ...
}
----
<1> No modification information present on `accept`.

[#singleton-annotation]
==== @Singleton

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {n}| Contract {n} | Type {y} | Field {n} | Method {n} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that the class is a <<concept-singleton, singleton>>: only one instance can exist.
Mode:: There is no opposite for this annotation.

Example:: There are many ways to ensure that a type has only one instance.
This is the simplest example:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class OnlyOne {
  public static final INSTANCE = new OnlyOne();

  public final int value;

  private OnlyOne() {
      value = new Random().nextInt(10);
  }
}

[#testMark-annotation]
==== @TestMark

|===
| Basic {n} | Immu {y}| Contract {y} | Type {n} | Field {n} | Method {y} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: Part of the <<concept-eventual,eventual>> system, this annotation is computed for methods which return the state of the object with respect to eventuality: _after_ is `true`, while _before_ is `false`.

Parameters:: a parameter `before` exists to reverse the values: when `before` is true, the method returns `true` when the state is _before_ and `false` when the state is _after_.

Mode:: There is no opposite for this annotation.

Example:: The {testMark} annotation in the following example returns `true` when `t != null`, i.e., _after_ the marked method `setT` has been called:

[source,java]
----
@E2Immutable(after = "t")
public class EventuallyE2Immutable_2<T> {

    private T t;

    @Mark("t")
    public void setT(T t) {
        if (t == null) throw new NullPointerException();
        if (this.t != null) throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        this.t = t;
    }

    @Only(after = "t")
    public T getT() {
        if (t == null) throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        return t;

[#utilityClass-annotation]
==== @UtilityClass

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {n}| Contract {n}| Type {y} | Field {n} | Method {n} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that the type is a <<concept-utility-class,utility class>>: its static side is eventually level 2 immutable, and it cannot be instantiated.
As a consequence, should only have static methods.

Mode:: There is no opposite for this annotation.
Details::
The level 2 immutability ensures that the (static) fields are sufficiently immutable.
The fact that it cannot be instantiated is verified by

. the fact that all constructors should be private;
. there should be at least one private constructor;
. no method or field can use the constructors instantiate objects of this type.

Example:: The following utility class is copied from the analyser:

[source,java]
----
@UtilityClass
public class IntUtil {

    private IntUtil() {
    }

    // copied from Guava, DoubleMath class
    public static boolean isMathematicalInteger(double x) {

[#variable-annotation]
==== @Variable

|===
| Basic {y} | Immu {y}| Contract {n} | Type {n} | Field {y} | Method {n} | Param {n}
|===

Summary:: This annotation indicates that a field is not <<concept-e1immutable,effectively or eventually final>>, i.e., it is assigned to in methods accessible from non-private non-constructor methods in the type.

Mode:: This annotation is the default in the green mode.
It is the opposite of {final}.

Example:: Any non-eventual type with setters will have fields marked {variable}:

[source,java]
----
@Container
class HoldsOneInteger {

  @Variable
  private int i;

  public void set(int i) {
    this.i = i;
