== Overview of annotations

=== Annotation modes

Depending on where you find yourself in the continuum between object-oriented programming and functional programming, or, put differently, almost never following the container and level 2 immutable rules, or mostly adhering to them, you may wish to be either notified for following the rules, or warned by the analyser for breaking the rules.
It is in this spirit that we envisage working in

Green mode:: we assume that containers and level 2 immutable objects are sparse, and want to highlight when you follow the rules.

Red mode:: when the majority of your types are level 2 immutable, and non-containers are rare, it may be more interesting to be warned when a type is _not_ following the rules.

Because annotations often occur in an opposing pair, the choice of a mode can help to reduce information overload.
For example, in red mode, <<mutableModifiesArguments-annotation>> will be prominently displayed, and
<<e2container-annotation>> will be "invisible".
Similarly, <<modified-annotation>> is highlighted and <<notModified-annotation>> will be plain.

In green mode, we want <<container-annotation>> and <<e2container-annotation>> to be visible, while "normal" types are unmarked in black.
The <<notModified-annotation>> will be highlighted, while <<modified-annotation>> remains plain.

=== Inheritance of annotations

In general, the analyser allows a method to do better than the method it overrides.
It will raise an error when the overriding method is {modified}, where the original is {nm}.
