== Annotated APIs

=== Purpose

The modification status of a class often depends on _foreign_ method calls: calls on objects defined outside your own code base.
In some situations, their source code is available, but that need not be the case.
So to build up a fair picture, one could say that the {e2immu} analyser would have to parse all types and methods "from the ground up", and decide on their modification status in an incremental way.
This procedure would be slow and hugely impractical.

On top of the incremental problem, APIs often come in the form of an interface without implementation.
Expressing the modification status by hand (the terminology we use is _contracting_, or writing the contract) is the only way forward.

Thirdly, manually annotating APIs can help you _override_ the implied modification status, or any other feature supported by the analyser.
Here are two simple examples why that can come in handy:

[source,java]
----
interface List<E> extends Collection<E> {
    ...
    @Modified
    boolean add(@NotNull E e);
}
----

Here, we acknowledge that `add` modifies the list, but we prohibit passing `null` as an element.
Secondly, we may decide to ignore modifications to the output stream `System.out`, by writing

[source,java]
----
class System {

    @IgnoreModifications
    @NotNull
    static final PrintStream out;

    @NotNull
    @IgnoreModifications
    static final PrintStream err;

    ...
}
----

so that we can still claim that the following method is not modifying:

[source,java]
----
@NotModified
static int square(int x) {
    int result = x*x;
    System.out.println("The square of "+x+" is "+result);
    return result;
}
----

It should be clear from these examples, and from the terminology used throughout the rest of the documentation, that we express the modification status, and other aspects of the code, by means of Java annotations.

In this section, we describe a practical way of annotating foreign APIs; we call it simply _Annotated API_ files.
The <<annotationxml-files,next section>> deals with a more compact form, _annotation XML_ files, which are less readable but (maybe) simpler and faster to load.

=== Preparing Annotated API files

Should we then start to systematically annotate all the libraries that our project uses?
That is one way of approaching the problem; however, because we have a source code analyser at hand, we can easily detect exactly which types, methods, and fields are used by our code.
The analyser's command line interpreter (CLI) provides options for generating a template Annotated API file for a whole library, for selected packages, or for exactly those types, methods and fields required.

The following Gradle task, taken from the `e2immu/annotation-store` project, contains the code to produce a single `IoVertxCore.java` file:

.Part of _build-api.gradle_ in _e2immu/annotation-store_
[source,groovy]
----

plugins {
    id 'java'
}

task runIoVertxAAPI(type: JavaExec) {
    group = "Execution"
    description = "Prepare an AnnotatedAPI file for io.vertx.core"

    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
    main = 'org.e2immu.analyser.cli.Main'

    Set<File> reducedClassPath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath.toList()
    reducedClassPath += sourceSets.test.runtimeClasspath
    reducedClassPath.removeIf({ f -> f.path.contains("build/classes")
        || f.path.contains("build/resources") })

    args('--classpath=' + reducedClassPath.join(":") + ":jmods/java.base.jmod",
            '-a',
            "--write-annotated-api-packages=io.vertx.core",
            "--source=none",
            "-d=CONFIGURATION,BYTECODE_INSPECTOR")
}
----

The task can be run with the command `./gradlew -b build-api.gradle runIoVertxAAPI`.

=== The Annotated API file format

Annotated API files are standard Java files, they will be inspected by a standard Java parser, so all normal syntax rules need to be followed.
They deviate in the following way:

* The primary types become sub-types of a primary type named after the package.
* To ensure that there is no clash with preloaded primary types, they have a dollar `$` suffix.
* A string constant, `PACKAGE_NAME`, specifies the package to which 'dollar types' are transferred.
* All types become classes, all methods return a default value.
Actually, none of the decorations to a type, method, or field matter, as long as the analyser can identify the structure uniquely.

This excerpt from the annotated API file for `java.util` used by the tests in the analyser, shows what this looks like:

.Start of the _JavaUtil.java_ annotated API file
[source,java]
----
public class JavaUtil {
    public static final String PACKAGE_NAME = "java.util";

    static class Enumeration$ {
        boolean hasMoreElements() { return false; }
        E nextElement() { return null; }
        Iterator<E> asIterator() { return null; }
    }

    static class Map$ {
        static class Entry {
            K getKey() { return null; }
            V getValue() { return null; }
    ...
----

Once all relevant types, methods and fields can be written, they can be annotated, as in:

.A second part of the _JavaUtil.java_ annotated API file
[source,java]
----
public class JavaUtil {
    public static final String PACKAGE_NAME = "java.util";

    ...

    @Container
    // this is not in line with the JDK, but we will block null keys!
    static class Collection$<E>  {

        boolean add$Postcondition(E e) { return contains(e); }
        @Modified
        boolean add(@Dependent1 @NotNull E e) { return true; }

        @Independent
        boolean addAll(@Dependent1 @NotNull1 java.util.Collection<? extends E> collection) {
            return true;
        }

        static boolean clear$Clear$Size(int i) { return i == 0; }
        @Modified
        void clear() { }

        static boolean contains$Value$Size(int i, Object o, boolean retVal) {
            return i != 0 && retVal;
        }
        @NotModified
        boolean contains(@NotNull Object object) { return true; }

        ...
    }
}
----

Also on display here are <<companion-methods>>, static methods describing either how the state of a `Collection` instance changes after a modifying method call, or certain edge cases can be resolved using this state information.

=== Annotation types

All {e2immu} annotations have a parameter of the enum type `AnnotationType`, which takes 4 different values:

VERIFY:: this is the default value inserted when parsing Java code.
This corresponds to the standard use of {e2immu} annotations: normally the analyser will compute them for you, but you may want to assert their presence.

VERIFY_ABSENT:: mostly for debugging: insert in the Java code by hand to make sure the analyser does not end up computing this assertion for you.

COMPUTED:: added to annotations inserted by the analyser

CONTRACT:: added to annotations inserted when parsing annotation XMLs or annotated APIs.
This type indicates that a value has not been computed, but stipulated by the user.

The list of available annotations can be found <<list-of-annotations,here>>.
In Annotated API files, CONTRACT is the default type, and needs not be specified.

=== The Collections framework

==== Not null

We strongly object to the use of `null` in sets and maps -- note that this can be valid point of view even if one embraces `null` as a valuable concept denoting _absence of a value_.
It is our opinion that one should not store _absence of a value_ in a set, nor should one use _absence of a value_ as the key in a map.
The same does not hold for arrays, and should therefore not be so important for lists.
But then, consistency prevails.
We are happy with `null` in arrays, but not in standard collections.

Consequently, our `java.util` annotated APIs are littered with {nn} and {nn1} annotations.
Note that we have not equipped {e2immu} with a {nn} annotation on types.
When a collection comes in as a parameter, and the collection should be present, {nn} is the obvious choice:

[source,java]
----
public int combinedSize(@NotNull Set<T> set) {
    return someValue + set.size();
}
----

There is no immediate meaning for {nn1} in this context: it is reserved for functional interfaces and arrays at the moment.

==== Iterating over maps

Interestingly, `Map.Entry` has a `setValue()` method which allows the developer to change the value of a mapping during iteration.
As a consequence, we annotate the mutable type as

[source,java]
----
@Container
@Independent1
interface Entry<K, V> {
    @NotNull
    K getKey();

    @NotNull
    V getValue();

    @Modified
    V setValue(V v);
}
----

The method `Map.entrySet()` returns a set of entries, which is a _view_ on the map, indicating that the set is backed by the map, and changes to the set imply changes to the map.
We must therefore annotate

[source,java]
----
@Container // and implicitly @Dependent
interface Map$<K, V> {
   ...

   // implicitly @Dependent
   @NotNull1
   Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> entrySet();
}
----

To use `entrySet()` in a for-each construct, we must annotate the interface `Iterable`, which is extended by `Collection` and therefore also by `Set`:

[source,java]
----
@Container // and implicitly @Dependent
interface Iterable$<T> {
    @NotModified
    void forEach(@NotNull @Independent1 Consumer<? super T> action);

    // implicitly @Dependent, `Iterator` has `remove()`
    @NotNull
    Iterator<T> iterator();

    @NotNull
    @Independent1
    Spliterator<T> spliterator();
}
----

Finally, we note that `Iterator` has a `remove()` operation, which makes every iterator dependent on its iterable source:

[source,java]
----
@Container
@Independent1
interface Iterator$<T> {
    @Modified
    default void forEachRemaining(@NotNull @Independent1 Consumer<? super T> action) {
    }

    @Modified
    boolean hasNext();

    @Modified // implicitly @Independent1
    T next();

    @Modified
    void remove();
}
----

With this background, we can analyse the dependencies between `entry` and `map` in the common construct

[source,java]
----
for(Entry<K, V> entry: map.entrySet()) {
    ...
}
----

which is equivalent to the more elaborate construct

[source,java]
----
Iterator<Entry<K, V>> iterator = map.entrySet().iterator();
while(iterator.hasNext()) {
    Entry<K, V> entry = iterator.next();
    K key = entry.getKey();
    ...
}
----

Both methods `entrySet()` and `iterator()` are {dependent}, so we start off with local variable `iterator` linked to `map`.
Modifications to the iterator (e.g., by calling the `remove()` method), will modify the map.

The `entry` is obtained by calling the method `next()` on the iterator, which is marked {independent1}.
This means that the method result is linked to the hidden content of the iterator, which consists of `Entry` objects.
These `Entry` objects, however, are not part of the hidden content of `Map`: only objects of types `K` and `V` have that property.
Because the `Entry` objects have been obtained from `Map` in a {dependent} way, and `Map` is mutable, we equate changes to an `Entry` object to changes to the map.

In a picture, the situation looks like:

image::forEach_asIs.png[title="Current situation, entry to map",id="foreach-asis"]

****
The links are: {independent1} from `entry` to `iterator`, {dependent} from `iterator` to the entry set, and {dependent} from the entry set to the `map`.
Because `entry` is hidden in `iterator`, and `iterator` is dependent on map `map`, and `entry` is not of a hidden type in `map`, and it is mutable, we link `entry` to `map` in a {dependent} way.
****

Suppose we tell the analyser that the user can never use the `setValue` method of `Entry`.
Then, `Entry` becomes {e2container}.
Because it is now immutable, `entry` can only be content linked to `map`, i.e., at the {independent1} level.
This is depicted by:

image::forEach_noSetValue.png[title="No setValue() method, entry to map",id="foreach-nosenvalue"]

Alternatively, we could forbid the modification of entry sets, e.g., by contracting `entrySet()` to return an {e2container} object.
(Calling a modifying method on such an object will cause {e2immu} to raise an error.) Then, `iterator`, still linked to the entry set, remains linked to the mutable `map`: while the _set_ is immutable, the non-hidden `Entry` objects are not.
As a consequence, `Entry` objects remain linked to the map, because the previous rule still applies.

image::forEach_immutableSet.png[title="entrySet() immutable, entry to map",id="foreach-entry"]

It would be safer to forbid the use of the `remove()` method in the iterator at the same time.
However, this does not change the linking situation:

image::forEach_immutableSetAndNoRemove.png[title="entrySet() immutable, and no remove() method, entry to map",id="foreach-entrynoremove"]

Finally, we remark that only changing the `remove()` method does not change the linking situation between `Entry` and `Map`.
